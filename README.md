# NGS-SWIFT

<b>Introduction</b>

<sub>NGS-SWIFT is a customized computational environments and packages essential for DNA and RNA sequence analysis with public and control-accessed NGS data in cloud. Instantiation of an cloud instance or instance clusters with ideal computing environment is much facilitated.</sub>

<sub><b>Included tools are: </b><br />
  popular aligners (bwa, bowtie2, soap2 etc), <br />
  variant callers (samtools/bcftools, freebayes, snptools, soapsnp, cortex, varscan etc), <br />
  RNAseq analysis tools (tophat, cufflinks, STAR, hisat etc), <br />
  Common utility tools (vcftools, bedtools, tabix, R etc), and <br />
  NCBI developed SRA Toolkit and NGS Software Development Kit.</sub><br />
  *assembly tools (falcon, soapdenovo, sga, wga/CA etc), <br />

<b>Full Features</b>

* <sub>Customized AMI with pre-configured tools - no more installations and configurations for tools</sub>
* <sub>Analyzing control-accessed dbGaP data directly without downloading - saving disc spaces and downloadin time</sub>
* <sub>Flexibility  - users can add their own (proprietary or licensed) tools as they like </sub>
* <sub>*Accessing public s3 NGS data like local file system - saving disc spaces and data transferring time</sub>
